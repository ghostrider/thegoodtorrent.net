Hello stranger, 

this is the public repository of https://www.thegoodtorrent.net - it's supposed to be a directory of sites that list  torrents for legal download, such as Academic data, etc. 

Please feel free to contribute a link through a pull request! 

You can add posts by adding a new file to content/posts/ 

It's all hugo based. 

Again, you are welcome to contribute, I add new sites very sporadically. 

Thanks and regards,
GhostRider.
