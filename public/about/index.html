<p>Hello,</p>
<p>thanks for visiting my site on the internet. These pages are a personal view on management topics. I am a line manager in a large bank and pursue a Doctor of Business Administration. Of course, all expressed opinions and materials are unrelated to my employer and represent a very personal stance. Over the years, I have held various management positions, have spoken at various occasions and started and contributed to several open source software projects - some of my own projects reached a bit of fame.</p>
<p>Thanks and have a great day,</p>
