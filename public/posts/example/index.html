<h1 id="problematising-process">Problematising process</h1>

<p>The problematising process has moved the focus of my attention from from
individual staff members to a closer lock at dominant culture within my
organization.</p>

<p>Initially, I looked at vertical information flow from a very simplistic
point of view. I asked, why does important information not reach the me?
This question contains many problems in itself, such as a subjective
definition of “important” (what’s important?). Through continued
interaction with fellow students, literature and the field, I refined my
problem statement to ’why does my company not have a proper, shared
reporting structure’ and ’how can I establish a reporting structure that
encourages people to pass on information?’.</p>

<h1 id="how-has-your-critical-literature-review-and-other-resources-from-the-module-supported-your-approach-to-solving-your-identified-problem">How has your Critical Literature Review and other resources from the module supported your approach to solving your identified problem?</h1>

<p>The critical literature review has provided the necessary background to
probe reality. Through the review, I learned that employee voice is
influenced by various factors from the domains of organizational culture
and organizational design. For example, organizational culture include
communication climate, and organizational design includes depth of
hierarchy, and span of control, as highlighted by J. R. Detert and
Burris (2007), J. Detert et al. (2013), Simpson (1959) and Mintzberg
(1979). I also identified the areas of organizational identification and
professional identification as viable origins of problems and thus
further probing.</p>

<p>The discussion of paradigms and metaphors in Morgan (1980) has raised my
awareness to identify common metaphors in conversations. Although Morgan
referred to metaphors used in certain areas of research, I am able to
identify metaphors also during conversations with peers and subjects.
Just today, during an informal interview session with two of my delivery
managers, it dawned on me that some of our problems are visible in the
clients’ and in our’s language, and the different metaphors in use at
two projects. Let’s briefly compare the two projects. In the first
project, the client speaks of us as partners, all client managers talk
about our staff as team members. In the second project, the client
speaks of us as a vendor or supplier, and of our staff as resources.
From our side, the first project contains highly committed staff,
whereas the second project suffers from high attrition and generally low
morale.</p>

<p>Of particular relevance were the concepts of knowledge creation and the
different methodological tools associated with them. The research into
paradigms and worldviews (Creswell 2014) yielded the right
methodological tools to understand the problem in depth. By gaining this
increased understanding, I am able to provide more relevant solutions.</p>

<h1 id="desired-outcomes">Desired outcomes</h1>

<h2 id="organisationally">Organisationally</h2>

<p>Initially, I approached my problem under the assumption that some
individuals need different instructions or a different modality of
contact with me. I falsely located the problem solely in individual
staff to not forward information along vertical communication
structures. The works of</p>

<p>Through conversations in our classroom, and Edward in particular, my
initial rough sketch of a the problem and its solution changed to fix a
possible cultural issue within my units. Ideally, I achieve to change
three areas: (1) corporate culture to change the identification
routines, (2) also, I want to build a culture of trust and (3) a climate
of safety to speak up.</p>

<h2 id="personally">Personally</h2>

<p>This module has familiarized me with the most relevant philosophical
worldviews on knowledge creation, science, and research. The classroom
discussions about four paradigms of Morgan (1980), regardless of whether
they are incommensurable or not, have started a period of search for
myself - what worldviews do I share, and what are my core values as a
researcher. Our classroom discussions have pushed me forward on this
journey: the need to reflect on others’ postings triggered extensive
periods of literature research and critical reflection about myself, my
position and what I want to achieve. In summary, I was able to locate
myself in the phenomenological and ethnographic space, as a social
constructivist. Over this and subsequent modules, I will try to hone
these areas.</p>

<h1 id="influence-of-this-module-s-ideas-and-practices">Influence of this module’s ideas and practices</h1>

<p>Let’s put it straight right here, the amount of philosophical concepts
was overwhelming. Positive epistemology, positivism, antipositivism,
constructionism, etc. - the words started to make sense after some time.
The different philosophical stances presented in this module have made
me more aware of how some people think and work. So far, this module has
added tremendously to my knowledge about how to understand and resolve
the problem. Predominantly, these two benefits result from readings like
Morgan (1980), Huff (2000), Rynes, Bartunek, and Daft (2001) and Huff
(2009). Critical literature, such as Lex Donaldson (1998; L. Donaldson
2008) have added another perspective on Morgan’s work. These
interactions with literature, and continued research into the topic have
exposed myself to phenomenology, ethnography, radical humanist views and
social constructivism and many other ideas. Exposure to postmodernism
made me anchor myself even more in the social constructivism space. Last
but not least, Morgan’s ideas about paradigms and metaphors have raised
my awareness of my and my peers’, and literature’s language and the
underlying assumptions conveyed. As a concrete example, inline with
literature, I concur calling the act of passing information to one’s
manager ’vertical communication’. This metaphor conveys the image of a
pyramid, with some people being on top and others at the bottom. As a
result, I intend to isolate my concepts from my the perception of my
subjects and I try to not use my metaphor during qualitative interviews
to reduce my influence on the outcome of my research.</p>

<h1 id="moving-forward-in-the-problem-solving-process">Moving forward in the problem-solving process</h1>

<p>Based on the above, my next steps include an informed data acquisition
through phenomenology inspired interviews. How this is going to look
like is subject of ongoing research into best practices. Once the
results are collected, I am going to reflect over these interviews to
see if the recorded narratives match theory. In the best case, staff
expresses similar reasons, either consciously or subconsciously through
metaphors, etc. as identified during my literature research. Equipped
with these results, I will kick off some improvement initiatives,
especially in the area of staff’s identification.</p>
