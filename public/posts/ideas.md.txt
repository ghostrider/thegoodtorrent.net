Some ideas for The Management Letters
-----------------------------------------


* Identification of staff with companies
* Multiple cultures at work
* financials .. 
* All posts should be emotionally engaging and interesting
* Maybe some marxism? 
* Something EU related, such as an essay on regulations 

* Summarize some of the Scrum articles that I found ... 

* Why does a unit have the leader it has? Is the leader a result of subconscious group processes (bottom up) or rather of a top down process? When is which leader chosen?  This question is not straight forward. For example, subconscious group processes might evoke some sort of a fitting approach in upper layers to choose a leader that fits the group. 
* Elaborate why every organizational activity is essentially an activity to establish a certain power structure.  Why do you think that organizational culture activities are locking people in a certain behaviour?  Why are certain approaches, like SCRUM, mechanisms to create processes that lock people in?  Is establishing processes about reducing innovation and critical thinking? ... thus again establishing a power structure? Note: Not all power structures are evil. 


About the structure of articles
-----------------------------------

* Articles should be around 500 words max
* Articles need to have proper references
* Should be written in good English
