## About me 
Hello, 

thanks for visiting my site on the internet. These pages are a personal view on management topics. I am a line manager in a large bank and pursue a Doctor of Business Administration. Of course, all expressed opinions and materials are unrelated to my employer and represent a very personal stance. Over the years, I have held various management positions, have spoken at various occasions and started and contributed to several open source software projects - some of my own projects reached a bit of fame. 

Thanks and have a great day, 

Ulrich Staudinger <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2707-9172" target="orcid.widget" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="vertical-align:top;"><img src="https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/images/orcid_16x16.png" style="width:1em;margin-right:.5em;" alt="ORCID iD icon"></a>
